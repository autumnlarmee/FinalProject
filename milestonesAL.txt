Challenge Report
----------------
This challenge went well. It was a lot of research and trying to figure out which ideas
would be viable for a final project. We settled on creating a python and custom c++ decision
tree to determine the probability that a patient has heart disease, and comparing the two 
approaches to see which is most efficient.
